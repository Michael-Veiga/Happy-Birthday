      <b class="stuffToDo"><u>And Now a Super Corny Poem!</u></b>
      <p>Searching for love in a stifling cinder,
        <br>suffering the heat a long lonely lindor,
        <br>swiped through a vast ocean of coals,
        <br>scorching his shoes with piercing red holes,
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly a witch emerged from the ember,
        <br>bestowing the lindor with boots made of timber,
        <br>She said I'm Hermione your love everlasting,
        <br>Now give me some ribs or i'll use my spellcasting,
      </p>
      <p>The lindor rejoiced and sought out a swine,
        <br>but all to be found were chips and moonshine,
        <br>perched precariously on a great thirsty moose,
        <br>while they drank he admired the witch's caboose,
      </p>
      <p>As the pair relished their open debut,
        <br>she talked excitedly of a strange brew,
        <br>a love potion perhaps he could feel in his face,
        <br>Sweetly she laughed not a drink but a place,
      </p>
      <p>Enchanted they flew with hearts light as air,
        <br>to find love so pure is exceedingly rare,
        <br>finding himself overflowing with bliss,
        <br>he sought to bestow the witch with a kiss,
      </p>
      <p>She blushed and she dodged and she muttered a spell,
        <br>and told the old lindor this wouldn't end well,
        <br>but even a man not six inches tall,
        <br>could tell she was hiding her heart from it all,
      </p>
      <p>So they laughed and they joked and they sat for a while,
        <br>until the young witch became trapped in her smile,
        <br>and when the old lindor returned to his height,
        <br>the witch let him kiss her all into the night.
